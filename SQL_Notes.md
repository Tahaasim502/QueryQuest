## 📑 Tables, Rows, and Columns  

- Tables have **rows** (records) and **columns** (fields).  
- The number of columns is usually fixed, but rows can be unlimited.  
- Use `SELECT` and `FROM` to extract data.  

```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name; -- Select specific columns  
SELECT * FROM table_name; -- Select all columns
